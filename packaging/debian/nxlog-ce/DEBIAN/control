Description: Modular, multi-threaded, high-performance log management solution
 In concept nxlog is similar to syslog-ng or rsyslog but it is not limited to
 unix and syslog only. It supports different platforms, log sources and formats
 so nxlog can be an ideal choice to implement a centralized logging system.
 .
 It can collect logs from files in various formats, receive logs from the
 network remotely over UDP, TCP or TLS/SSL on all supported platforms. It
 supports platform specific sources such as the Windows Eventlog, Linux kernel
 logs, Android device logs, local syslog etc. Writing and reading logs to/from
 databases is also supported for many database servers. The collected logs can
 be stored into files, databases or forwarded to a remote log server using
 various protocols. The old BSD Syslog and the newer IETF syslog standard (RFC
 3164 and RFC 5424-5426) is fully supported by nxlog in addition to other
 custom formats. A key concept in nxlog is to be able to handle and preserve
 structured logs so there is no need to convert everything to syslog and then
 parse these logs again at the other side. It has powerful message filtering,
 log rewrite and conversion capabilities. Using a lightweight, modular and
 multithreaded architecture which can scale, nxlog can process hundreds of
 thousands of events per second.
 .
  * Multi-platform - support for Unix (Linux, HPUX, BSD), Windows, Android
  * Modular architecture through dynamically loadable plugins
  * Scalable, high-performance I/O - collect messages at blazing speeds (can
    achieve above 500k EPS)
  * Message buffering and prioritization - no lost or dropped messages
  * Simple configuration format with a powerful language similar to Perl
  * Scheduled tasks and built-in log rotation
  * Support for different formats such as Syslog, CSV, GELF, JSON, XML,
    Windows EventLog and even custom formats
  * Offline processing mode for post processing, conversion or transfer
  * Event classification and pattern matching
  * Log message rewrite, conversion between different formats
  * Secure network transport over SSL
  * Internationalization for supporting different character sets and on the
    fly auto-detection of encodings
